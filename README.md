# Productivity-Manager---Life-Clock
Imagine if you would have only a certain period left to live. Would you feel happy dying thinking you have completed all your dreams? 
Or perhaps you should prioritize them while you live?

This project is a tool that would help you to organize your life time goals and set priorites for them based on how soon you would like to do them.
Most people don't work towards most craze and interesting dreams as they think there's always a time to do that. Simply because we do nto like to think about our death.
However this will happen some day and nobody knows when. So maybe it is better to think first about the stuff that will please you most and will give you the best satisfaction?

That's why I designed this page to help you with this task. Introduction contains the explanation of the purpose of this tool and some background. 
It also explains how to use it and after each operation new instructions are revealed.
