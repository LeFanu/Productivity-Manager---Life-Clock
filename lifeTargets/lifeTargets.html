                is someone I want to tell you about. He needed kidney transplant and fortunately was able to get one.
                Everything seemed to be just fine. Then, in his mid 20's, he found out that kidney was rejected and he'd have to wait in line for the next one.
                Problem was, that doctors didn't give him enough time to live to get it.
                <br />
                Greg was told the time he had left. Successful young entrepreneur with big ambition suddenly taken down by such news. But he didn't give up.
                He decided to fight and continue working hard, but he had to come up with new approach to all things. That's how he created life clock.
                Cannot say for sure if it's his idea alone, however this page is based on it. This idea was presented on ALIVE conference in Berlin.

                There is one undeniable truth about all of us:
                <br/>
                <span><strong>WE ALL are dying! WE ALL are going to die!</strong></span>
            <br/>
                No one can escape that.
                    <br />As much as we do not want to think about it, it's plain obvious and it creeps onto us every second.
                The question is:
                    </p>
            <p><cite>What are we going to do about this?</cite>
            </p>
                Don't get me wrong!
            This page is not suppose to demotivate you and make you thinking about the end of our life and all the sad things.
            Sadly it's inevitable, and it's up to us, how are we going to approach this.
            This page should help you with this.
            <br />
                If you are still in doubt please read it all again or please check on that great article summarizing Greg's presentation on ALIVE:

                We all should remember the time is the only thing we can never get back and every day we're getting older.

            <p >This exercise allows you to write down your goals and any things you'd love to do in your life.
                You may write as many as you wish. Then you should follow the instructions to segregate those goals and prioritize them.
                Having in mind you may die unexpectedly. Therefore, try to think about those goals as things you want to do most before you die.<br />
                Which ones you'd do first as in case if you'd die, you could think you're dying happy, as you have accomplished what you have always dreamed of.
                Or at least big part of it.<br>
                In the box below write down your list. Please separate each thing with enter key as you would do in any text editor. <br />
                Once finished please press the button below and follow the instructions.
                There will be some new elements on the page.
                The goal in here is to segregate your life list in a way which will help you,
                to find out what is most important and when you think you should do it.
